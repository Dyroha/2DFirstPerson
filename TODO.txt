Figure out how a first person camera in 2D will be calculated
e.g. if using "ray tracing" or drawing shapes relative to camera
Got to work out skew of distance and perspective change ect.

Make 2D "game" with simple controles and objects

Make a renderer for different visualisations of distance
    - darker with range
    - dottet lines?
